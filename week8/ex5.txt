According to the virtual memory method program is divided into several parts called pages. Pages that are used by the process at the current time are stored in the RAM and have a physical address. Not used pages of the process are stored in the hard drive. Then process page that is not currently in the physical memory is needed system calls page fault error and then it is swapped from the hard drive to the memory management unit and from it, the virtual address converts to the physical address. So the difference between the virtual address and physical address is that for the page the physical address exactly know the place of the command in the RAM and for the virtual address it should be converted with MMU first
