intial hit/miss ratio is 1.079096045
with 191 hits and 177 misses.
If we would like to increase hit/miss ratio
we should change some references which call miss.
As we can see from the initial output of the program
8 last calls of the references cause swapping and return 0.
and if we change them to the same reference as the previous 
we will recive hit from this calls. So new hit/miss ratio will be 1.177514793
with 199 hits and 169 misses.
